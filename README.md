# CS792-rPPG

Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is the application of computer vision (CV) to predict vital signs such as but not limited to heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR) through facial videos (Chen et. al 1.2). Defined broadly, rPPG uses cameras to record variations of light absorption and reflection by the skin, which fluctuates based on hemodynamic status (Chen et al. 1.2). Machine learning algorithms detect these changes and process the signals (i.e. noise filtering) to produce waveforms that reflect respective vital signs (Chen et al. 1.2). Compared to traditional photoplethysmography (PPG), rPPG allows for the collection of biometric data without the need for physical contact thereby contributing to cost/time efficiency, non-invasive monitoring methods, and the elimination of potential methods of transmission (Malmberg et al. 1, Rohmetra et al. 9). Leveraging this technology for remote patient monitoring not only advances preventative public health measures, but also furthers the field of telehealth by enabling long distance diagnosis, and continuous monitoring of vital signs for the management of chronic diseases (Rohmetra et al. 9). Likewise, this project will explore advancements of rPPG technology and enhance current state of the art (SOTA) measurement accuracy by focusing on blood pressure measurements in the senoir east-asian population.
